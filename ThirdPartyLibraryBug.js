This error occurs when using a third-party library that is not properly configured or has conflicts with other libraries.  The error message itself might not be very helpful, often simply stating that the library is not found or is not working correctly.  Debugging involves examining the library's documentation, checking the installation process, and ensuring that it is compatible with other dependencies and the current React Native version. Conflicts can sometimes arise from mismatched version numbers or incorrect linking of native modules.
