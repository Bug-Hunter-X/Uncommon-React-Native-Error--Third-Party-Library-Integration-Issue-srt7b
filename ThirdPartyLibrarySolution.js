The solution focuses on systematically investigating the third-party library's integration. This involves:

1. **Verify Library Installation:** Double-check that the library is correctly installed using `npm list HypotheticalLibrary` or `yarn why HypotheticalLibrary`. Ensure the version matches the project's requirements.
2. **Check Dependencies:** Verify all peer and regular dependencies of `HypotheticalLibrary` are met and compatible.  Use the library's documentation to check for compatibility notes.
3. **Review Linking (If Applicable):**  If the library requires native modules, confirm the native modules are properly linked. This often involves running additional commands and possibly modifying Xcode or Android Studio projects.
4. **Examine Library Documentation:**  Carefully read the library's documentation, paying attention to setup instructions, troubleshooting sections, and common issues.  Look for potential issues related to your app's environment.
5. **Simplify and Isolate:** Create a minimal reproducible example to isolate the problem and determine if the issue is caused by the library itself or a specific interaction with your code.
6. **Update React Native and Dependencies:** Sometimes, upgrading React Native or updating other related packages can fix compatibility problems.
7. **Check for Conflicts:** Use `npm ls` or `yarn why` to analyze the dependency tree and identify any potential conflicts.
8. **Seek Community Support:** If none of the previous steps work, consult the library's community forums or issue tracker to see if others have reported and solved similar problems.
